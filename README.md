# Hunting Sterile Neutrinos in the atmosphere 

**Run this code to reproduce some of the results for the search of sterile neutrinos produced in extensive air showers, which originates from cosmic rays collisions with the earth's atmosphere. The signal events are expected to be detected in the Super-Kamiokande underground neutrino detector.**
